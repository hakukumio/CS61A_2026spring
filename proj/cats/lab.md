In this project, you will write a program that measures typing speed.
Additionally, you will implement typing autocorrect, which is a feature that
attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. This project
is inspired by [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/ "https://play.typeracer.com/").

When you finish the project, you'll have implemented a significant part of
this yourself, including the multiplayer mode!

Logistics
---------

The project is worth 20 points.
19 points are for correctness
and 1 point is for submitting Phases 1 & 2 by the checkpoint date.

You will turn in the following files:

* `cats.py`

You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project,  **submit the required files to the appropriate Gradescope assignment.**

You may not use artificial intelligence tools to help you with this project
or reference solutions found on the internet.

For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.

**However, please do not modify any other functions or edit any files not
listed above**. Doing so may result in your code failing our autograder tests.
Also, please do not change any function signatures (names, argument order, or
number of arguments).

Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing *too* often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.

We have provided an **autograder** called `ok` to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to **log in with your Ok account using your web
browser**. Please do so. Each time you run `ok`, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.

The primary purpose of `ok` is to test your implementations.



















If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

```
 python3 ok -q [question number] -i
```

with the appropriate question number (e.g. `01`) inserted.
This will run the tests for that question until the first one you failed,
then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.

You can also use the debugging print feature in OK by prefixing your print statements with "DEBUG:".
For example, if you wanted to inspect the value of a variable `x`, you could write:

```
 print(f"DEBUG: x is {x}")
```

which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail
with extra output.


Phase 1: Typing
===============

> **Reminder**: Throughout the project, we will only be making changes to functions in `cats.py`.
>
> **Type Checking**
> Make sure you have type checking enabled before starting the project! See [here](../../lab/lab03/index.html#type-checking "../../lab/lab03/index.html#type-checking").

### Problem 1 (1 pt)

Implement `pick`. This function selects which paragraph the user will type for the typing test.
It takes three parameters:

* `paragraphs`: a list of potential paragraphs (strings)
* `select`: a function that evaluates a paragraph and returns `True` if it meets certain criteria, and `False` otherwise
* `k`: a non-negative integer representing the index of the desired paragraph among those that meet the criteria

The `pick` function returns the `k`th paragraph from `paragraphs` for which the `select` function returns `True`.
If no such paragraph exists (because `k` is greater than or equal to the number of qualifying paragraphs), then `pick`
returns an empty string.

> **Hint**:
> Don't worry about the specific implementation of the `select` function. Just assume it takes a paragraph as input and
> returns `True` or`False`.
> **Reminder**: Indexing starts at 0. If `k` is 0, we want to pick the *first* qualifying paragraph.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

```
python3 ok -q 01 -u

Copy

✂️
```

  

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

```
python3 ok -q 01

Copy

✂️
```

  

### Problem 2 (1 pt)

Implement the `about` function, which takes a list of words called `keywords`. It returns a
function that, when given a paragraph, checks whether the paragraph contains any of
the words in `keywords`. The returned function will return `True` if any of the
words in the keywords list are found in the paragraph and `False` otherwise.

Once `about` is implemented, we can use the function it returns as the `select` argument in `pick`.
This is useful because it allows us to filter paragraphs based on whether they contain any words from the keywords list provided to the `about` function.
This functionality will be useful as we continue to develop our typing test.

To ensure accurate comparisons, you will need to:

1. Ignore case (treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent).
2. Ignore punctuation in the paragraph.
3. Only check for exact matches of the words in the `keywords` list, not substrings.
   For example, instances of "dogs" in `paragraph` should not match "dog" in `keywords`.

> **Hint**:
> Use the `split`, `lower`, and `remove_punctuation` functions in `utils.py`.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

```
python3 ok -q 02 -u

Copy

✂️
```

  

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

```
python3 ok -q 02

Copy

✂️
```

  

### Problem 3 (2 pts)

Implement `accuracy`, which takes both a `entered` paragraph and a `source`
paragraph. It returns the percentage of words in `entered` that exactly match
the corresponding words in `source`. Case and punctuation must match as
well. "Corresponding" means that each word in `entered` must appear in the same position as the matching word in `source`. In other words, the first word in `entered` must match the first word in `source`, the second word in `entered` must match the second word in `source`, and so on.

A *word* in this context is any sequence of characters separated from other
words by whitespace. Therefore, treat sequences like "dog;" as a single word.

In the actual typing test, `entered` represents what the player has typed, and `source` is the paragraph they are attempting to replicate.

* If `entered` is longer than `source`, then the extra words in `entered` that have no corresponding word in `source` are all *incorrect*.
* If `entered` is shorter than `source` and all the words in `entered` correspond to `source` so far, then the accuracy is 100.0.
* If `entered` is empty and `source` is empty, then the accuracy is 100.0.
* If `entered` is empty but `source` is not empty, then the accuracy is 0.0.
* If `entered` is not empty but `source` is empty, then the accuracy is 0.0.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

```

  

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

```
python3 ok -q 03

Copy

✂️
```

  

### Problem 4 (1 pt)

Implement `wpm`, which computes the *words per minute*, a measure of typing
speed, given a string `entered` and the amount of `elapsed` time in **seconds**.
Despite its name, *words per minute* is not based on the number of words typed,
but instead the number of groups of 5 characters, so that a typing test is not
biased by the length of words. The formula for *words per minute* is calculated by dividing the total number of characters typed (including spaces) by 5 (the average word length) and then dividing the result by the elapsed time in **minutes**.

For example, the string `"I am glad!"` contains ten characters
(not including the quotation marks). The words per minute calculation uses 2 as
the number of words entered (because 10 / 5 = 2). If someone typed this string in
30 seconds (half a minute), their speed would be 4 words per minute.

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

```
python3 ok -q 04 -u

Copy

✂️
```

  

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

```
python3 ok -q 04

Copy

✂️
```

  

**Time to test your typing speed!** You can use the command line to test your
typing speed on paragraphs about a particular subject. For example, the command
below will load paragraphs about cats or kittens. See the `run_typing_test`
function for the implementation if you're curious (but it is defined for you).

```
python3 cats.py -t cats kittens
```

You can also try out the web-based graphical user interface (GUI) using the
following command.
(You may have to use `Ctrl+C` or `Cmd+C` on your terminal to quit the GUI
after you close the tab in your browser).

```
python3 cats_gui.py
```

Phase 2: Autocorrect
====================

In the web-based GUI, there is an "Enable Auto-Correct" option, but right now it
doesn't do anything. Let's implement automatic typo correction. Whenever the
user presses the space bar, if the last word they typed doesn't match a word in
the dictionary but is close to one, then that similar word will be substituted
for what they typed.

### Problem 5 (2 pts)

Implement `autocorrect`, which takes a `entered_word`, a
`word_list`, a `diff_function`, and a `limit`. The goal of `autocorrect`
is to return the word in `word_list` that is closest to the provided
`entered_word`, as determined by `diff_function`.

Specifically, `autocorrect` does the following:

* If the `entered_word` is contained inside the `word_list`, `autocorrect`
  returns that word.
* Otherwise, `autocorrect` returns the word from `word_list`
  that has the lowest difference from the provided `entered_word`.
  This difference is the number returned by the `diff_function`.
* However, if the lowest difference between `entered_word` and any
  of the words in `word_list` is greater than `limit`, then `entered_word` is returned
  instead. In other words, `limit` sets a maximum threshold on how severe a typo can
  be for it to still be corrected.

Assume that `entered_word` and all elements of `word_list` are lowercase and
have no punctuation.

> **Important**:
> If multiple strings in `word_list` are tied for the lowest difference
> from `entered_word`, `autocorrect` should return the string that appears
> earliest (with the smallest index) in `word_list`.

A diff function takes in three arguments. The first is the `entered_word`, the second is
the source word (in this case, a word from `word_list`), and
the third argument is the `limit`. The output of the diff function, which is
a number, represents the amount of difference between the two strings.

Here is an example of a diff function that computes the minimum of `1 + limit`
and the difference in length between the two input strings:

```
>>> def length_diff(w1, w2, limit):
...     return min(limit + 1, abs(len(w2) - len(w1)))
>>> length_diff('mellow', 'cello', 10)
1
>>> length_diff('hippo', 'hippopotamus', 5)
6
```

> **Note**:
> For conciseness, some unlocking tests use a ternary operator when defining a lambda function. A ternary operator is the one-line version of an `if` statement.
>
> For example, in one of the ok tests, we define a diff function as `first_diff = lambda w1, w2, limit: 1 if w1[0] != w2[0] else 0`.
> Here, lambda function returns 1 if the first characters of `w1` and `w2` are different, otherwise it returns 0.

Here is a helpful hint for implementing `autocorrect`:

> **Note**:
> Optionally, for a one-line solution, try using `max` or `min` with the optional `key` argument (which takes in a one-argument function).
> For example, `max([-7, 2, -1], key=abs)` would return `-7` since `abs(-7)` is greater than `abs(2)` and `abs(-1)`.

Copy

✂️
```

  

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

```
python3 ok -q 05

Copy

✂️
```

  

### Problem 6 (3 pts)

Implement `furry_fixes`, a diff function that could be passed into the `diff_function` parameter in `autocorrect`.
This function takes in two strings and returns the minimum number of characters that must be changed in the `entered`
word in order to transform it into the `source` word. If the strings are not of
equal length, the difference in lengths is added to the total change count.

Here are some examples:

```
>>> big_limit = 10
>>> furry_fixes("nice", "rice", big_limit)    # Substitute: n -> r
1
>>> furry_fixes("range", "rungs", big_limit)  # Substitute: a -> u, e -> s
2
>>> furry_fixes("pill", "pillage", big_limit) # Don't substitute anything, length difference of 3.
3
>>> furry_fixes("goodbye", "good", big_limit) # Don't substitute anything, length difference of 3.
3
>>> furry_fixes("roses", "arose", big_limit)  # Substitute: r -> a, o -> r, s -> o, e -> s, s -> e
5
>>> furry_fixes("rose", "hello", big_limit)   # Substitute: r->h, o->e, s->l, e->l, length difference of 1.
5
```

> **Important**:
> You may not use `while`, `for`, or list comprehensions in your implementation.
> Use recursion.

If the number of characters that must change is greater than `limit`,
then `furry_fixes` should return any number larger than `limit` and
should minimize the amount of computation needed to do so.

> Why is there a limit? From Problem 5, we know that `autocorrect` will reject any `source`
> word whose difference with the `entered` word is greater than `limit`. It doesn't
> matter if the difference is greater than `limit` by 1 or by 100; autocorrect will
> reject it just the same. Therefore, as soon as we know the difference is above `limit`,
> it makes sense to stop making recursive calls, saving time,
> even if the returned difference won't be exactly correct.
>
> These two calls to `furry_fixes` should take about the same amount of time to
> evaluate:
>
> ```
> >>> limit = 4
> >>> furry_fixes("roses", "arose", limit) > limit
> True
> >>> furry_fixes("rosesabcdefghijklm", "arosenopqrstuvwxyz", limit) > limit
> True
> ```

To ensure that you are correctly saving time by stopping the recursion after
`limit` is reached, there is an autograder test that measures the performance of
your solution based on the number of function calls that it makes. If you fail
this test, consider adding a base case related to the `limit`.

> **Hint**: you will need more than one base case to solve this problem.

String Slicing (enable JavaScript)

A string is a sequence of characters. (Letters, digits, and punctuation are all characters.) A slice of a string is another string that contains some of the characters of the original. Here are some examples:

```
>>> a = 'strap'
>>> a[0]
's'
>>> a[1:]
'trap'
>>> a[2:]
'rap'
>>> a[1:][1:]
'rap'
```

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

```
python3 ok -q 06 -u

Copy

✂️
```

  

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

```
python3 ok -q 06

Copy

✂️
```

  

Try enabling auto-correct in the GUI. Does it help you type faster? Are the
corrections accurate?

### Problem 7 (3 pts)

Implement `minimum_mewtations`, a more advanced diff function that can be used in `autocorrect`, which
returns the *minimum* number of edit operations needed to transform the `entered` word into
the `source` word.

There are three kinds of edit operations, with some examples:

1. Add a letter to `entered`.

   * Adding `"k"` to `"itten"` gives us `"kitten"`.
2. Remove a letter from `entered`.

   * Removing `"s"` from `"scat"` gives us `"cat"`.
3. Substitute a letter in `entered` for another.

   * Substituting `"z"` with `"j"` in `"zaguar"` gives us `"jaguar"`.

Each edit operation increases the difference between two words by 1.

```
>>> big_limit = 10
>>> minimum_mewtations("cats", "scat", big_limit)       # cats -> scats -> scat
2
>>> minimum_mewtations("purng", "purring", big_limit)   # purng -> purrng -> purring
2
>>> minimum_mewtations("ckiteus", "kittens", big_limit) # ckiteus -> kiteus -> kitteus -> kittens
3
```

We have provided a template of an implementation in `cats.py`. You may modify the template however you want or delete it entirely.

> **Hint:**
> One of the recursive calls in `minimum_mewtations` will be similar to `furry_fixes`.
> However, because `minimum_mewtations` considers three *specific* types of edits (add, remove, substitute),
> there will need to be additional recursive calls to handle each of these cases.

If the number of edits required is greater than `limit`, then
`minimum_mewtations` should return **any number** larger than `limit` (such as
`limit + 1`) and should stop making recursive calls once the limit is reached to
save time.

> These two calls to `minimum_mewtations` should take about the same amount of
> time to evaluate:
>
> ```
> >>> limit = 2
> >>> minimum_mewtations("ckiteus", "kittens", limit) > limit
> True
> >>> minimum_mewtations("ckiteusabcdefghijklm", "kittensnopqrstuvwxyz", limit) > limit
> True
> ```

To ensure that your code stops making recursive calls after the `limit` is
reached, there is an autograder test that measures the performance of your
solution based on the number of function calls that it makes.

> **Important**:
> You *should not* use any helper functions in your implementation of `minimum_mewtations`. Otherwise the autograder test might fail.
>
> **Important**:
> Remember to remove the following line of code when you are ready to test your implementation:
>
> ```
> assert False, 'Remove this line'
> ```

Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question:

Copy

✂️
```

  

Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:

```
python3 ok -q 07

Copy

✂️
```

  

Try enabling auto-correct and typing again. Are the corrections more accurate?

```
python3 cats_gui.py
```

### (Optional) Extension: Final Diff (0 pts)

You may optionally design your own diff function called
`final_diff`. Here are some ideas for making even more accurate corrections:

* Take into account which additions and deletions are more likely than others.
  For example, it's much more likely that you'll accidentally leave out a
  letter if it appears twice in a row.
* Treat two adjacent letters that have swapped positions as one change,
  not two.
* Try to incorporate common misspellings.
* Letters near to each other on the keyboard are more commonly substituted.

You can also set the limit you'd like your diff function to use by changing
the value of the variable `FINAL_DIFF_LIMIT` in `cats.py`.

You can check your `final_diff`'s success rate on a provided dataset of common
misspellings by running:

```
 python3 score.py
```

If you don't know where to start, try copy-pasting your code for `furry_fixes`
and `minimum_mewtations` into `final_diff` and scoring them. Looking at the
typos they fixed (and didn't fix) might give you some ideas!

Checkpoint Submission
=====================

Check to make sure that you completed all the problems in Phase 1 and Phase 2:

```
python3 ok --score
```

When you run `ok` commands, you'll still see that some tests are locked
because you haven't completed the whole project yet. You'll get full credit for
the checkpoint if you correctly complete all the problems up to this point.

Once you are satisfied, submit the checkpoint by uploading `cats.py` to the Cats Checkpoint assignment **on Gradescope.**
Be sure to submit before the checkpoint deadline of Thursday 02/26.
For a refresher on how to submit to Gradescope, refer to [Lab 00](../../lab/lab00.html#3-running-tests "../../lab/lab00.html#3-running-tests").

You can add a partner to your Gradescope submission by clicking on **Edit Group** and entering their email address.
Only one partner needs to submit to Gradescope.

Phase 3: Multiplayer
====================

Typing is more fun with friends! You'll now implement multiplayer
functionality, so that when you run `cats_gui.py` on your computer,
it connects to the course server at
[cats.cs61a.org](https://cats.cs61a.org "https://cats.cs61a.org")
and looks for someone else to race against.

To race against a friend, 5 different programs will be running:

* Your GUI, which is a program that handles all the text coloring and display
  in your web browser.
* Your `cats_gui.py`, which is a web server that communicates with your GUI using
  the code you wrote in `cats.py`.
* Your opponent's `cats_gui.py`.
* Your opponent's GUI.
* The CS 61A multiplayer server, which matches players together and passes
  messages around.

When you type, your GUI uploads what you have typed to your `cats_gui.py` server,
which computes how much progress you have made and returns a progress update.
This server also uploads a progress update to the CS 61A multiplayer server, so that your
opponent's GUI can also display your progress.

Meanwhile, your GUI display constantly tries to stay current by requesting
your opponent's progress updates from `cats_gui.py`, which, in turn, retrieves
that information from the multiplayer server.

Each player has an `id` number that is used by the server to track typing
progress.

### Problem 8 (2 pts)

Implement `report_progress`, which is called every time the user finishes
typing a word. It takes a list of the words `entered` so far, a list of the words in the `source` text, the user's `user_id`, and an `upload` function that is used to upload
a progress report to the multiplayer server. There will never be more words in
`entered` than in `source`.

Your progress is a ratio of the words in the `source` that you have entered
correctly, up to the first incorrect word, divided by the number of `source`
words. For instance, this example has a progress of `0.25`:

```
report_progress(["Hello", "ths", "is"], ["Hello", "this", "is", "wrong"], ...)
```

Your `report_progress` function should:

1. Upload a message to the multiplayer server by calling the `upload` function with a dictionary containing two keys: `'id'` and `'progress'`. The `'id'` key should be set to the user's `user_id`, and the `'progress'` key should store the computed progress for the user, as defined above.
2. Return the user's computed progress.

> **Hint:**
> See the dictionary below for an example of a potential input to the `upload`
> function.
> This dictionary represents a player with `user_id` 4 and `progress` 0.6.
>
> `{'id': 4, 'progress': 0.6}`

### Problem 9 (1 pt)

Implement `time_per_word`, which takes in two arguments:

1. `words`: a list of words that players are typing.
2. `timestamps_per_player`: a list of lists where each inner list contains the timestamps indicating
   when each player finished typing each word in `words`.

The function should return a dictionary with the following structure:

* `'words'`: The list of words that the players are typing.
* `'times'`: A list of lists `times` that stores the durations it took each player to type each word. Specifically, the value at `times[i][j]`should indicate
  how long it took player `i` to type the word at `words[j]`. This would be the difference between when the player finished typing `words[j]` and when the player finished typing `words[j-1]`. For `words[0]`, this would be the difference between when the player finished typing `words[0]` and when the player started typing.

Timestamps found in the parameter `timestamps_per_player` are
cumulative and always increasing, while the values in `times` are
**differences between consecutive timestamps for each player**.

Here's an example:
If `timestamps_per_player = [[1, 3, 5], [2, 5, 6]]`, then `times` would be `[[2, 2], [3, 1]]`.

This is because the first player finished typing each word at timestamps `1`, `3`, and `5`, while the second player finished typing each word at timestamps `2`, `5`, and `6`.
So the differences in timestamps are
`(3-1)`, `(5-3)` for the first player and
`(5-2)`, `(6-5)` for the second player.
The first value of each list within `timestamps_per_player` represents the
initial starting time for each player.

### Problem 10 (3 pts)

Implement `fastest_words`, which returns which words each player entered fastest.
This function is called once all players have finished typing.
It takes in a dictionary returned by `time_per_word`.

The `fastest_words` function returns a list of lists of words, one list for each
player. The index of the nested list denotes the player. The list for each player contains the words they entered faster
than all the other players. In the case of a tie, the player with the smallest
index is considered to be the one who entered it the fastest.

For example, consider two players who typed `Just have fun`. Player 0 typed
`'fun'` the fastest (3 seconds), Player 1 typed `'Just'` the fastest (4
seconds), and they tied on the word `'have'` (both took 1 second). In this case,
Player 0 is considered the fastest for `'have'` because their index is smaller.

```
>>> player_0 = [5, 1, 3]
>>> player_1 = [4, 1, 6]
>>> fastest_words({'words': ['Just', 'have', 'fun'], 'times': [player_0, player_1]}) # player 0 -> ['have', 'fun'], player 1 -> ['Just']
[['have', 'fun'], ['Just']]
```

Use the helper function `get_time` (provided) to get an individual time from `times`. It provides helpful error messages when you try to access a time that doesn't exist.

```
def get_time(times, player_num, word_index):
    """Return the time it took player_num to type the word at word_index,
    given a list of lists of times returned by time_per_word."""
```

> **Important**:
> Make sure your implementation does not mutate the given player input lists.
> For the example above, calling `fastest_words` on `[player_0, player_1]`
> should **not** mutate `player_0` or `player_1`.
>
> There might not always be two players, so generalize this function in a
> way that will allow it to handle an indeterminate number of players.

Phase 4: Efficiency (Extra Challenge)

> In this problem, you will implement memoization decorators that will increase the efficiency of our our program by "remembering" the results of particularly intensive operations.

Make sure you're familiar with the decorators and memoization. If you would like a refresher, open the dropdown boxes below for more information.

Decorators (enable JavaScript)

A Python decorator allows you to modify a pre-existing function without changing the function's structure.

Specifically, a decorator function is a higher-order function that...

* Takes the original function as an input
* Returns a new function with modified functionality
* This new function **must** contain the same arguments as the original function

An example of a decorator that executes a one-input function twice is shown below:

```
>>> def do_twice(original_function):
...     def repeat(x):
...             original_function(x)
...             original_function(x)
...     return repeat
```

We can apply this function in multiple contexts:

```
# Printing a value twice
>>> @do_twice
... def print_value(x):
...     print(x)
...
>>> print_value(5)
5
5
# Adding an item to a list twice
>>> lst = []
>>> @do_twice
... def add_to_list(item):
...     lst.append(item)
...
>>> add_to_list(5)
>>> lst
[5, 5]
```

Additionally, note that we could also directly call the decorator function instead of using the `@` notation (i.e. `print_value = do_twice(print_value)`).
However, it's typically useful to place decorators directly above the function that we are modifying since they better describe how these functions
are being changed in our code.

Memoization (enable JavaScript)

Notice that the diff functions we wrote in the previous questions are very inefficient: you will likely find that the computer will make the same recursive call multiple times. For a function with multiple arguments and three recursive calls, this can be harder to see. It can be easier to first see this with a function like `fib` that is defined in lecture.

![Fib Tree](images/fib_tree.png)

Noticed how many redundant recursive calls there are in the above tree diagram. Our goal is to have our program store past results of evaluated recursive calls so that we can reuse them if the same recursive call comes up in the future. For example, the first branch of `fib(5)` calls `fib(3)`, which has not yet been evaluated. So we must go through all of its subsequent recursive calls to find its return value. However when we encounter the call to `fib(3)` that is a branch of `fib(4)`, we have already found its return value before! So if we have a way to store and retrieve that information in something called a cache, we can avoid needless computation. We no longer need to make any subsequent recursive calls to its branches `fib(1)` and `fib(2)`. This
is the concept of **memoization**: store the results of expensive computations in a cache, and retrieve information from the cache in the case we
execute a repeated action.

  

We will be working with two memoization decorators. `memo` is a general all-purpose decorator that memoizes the function it annotates. If `memo` encounters
an input it has not seen, it will store the calculated result into its `cache`. If `memo` receives an input it has already seen, it will take the stored
value in the `cache` and returns it directly without doing any extra computation. We have provided you with the full implementation of `memo`.

Your task is to implement `memo_diff`. `memo_diff` is a higher-order function that takes in a `diff_function` and returns another diff function called `memoized` that, like all diff functions, takes in `entered`, `source`, and `limit`. `memoized` should do the following:

* When `memoized` sees a (`entered`, `source`) pair for the first time, it should calculate the
  difference using `diff_function` and cache that value along with the `limit` used as a (`value`, `limit`) tuple pair.
* If `memoized` encounters the (`entered`, `source`) pair again, it should return the memoized
  `value` if the provided `limit` is less than or equal to the cached limit. Otherwise, the
  difference should be recalculated, recached, and returned.

> **Important:** When implementing this function, make sure you store pairs of values in the cache
> with a tuple, **not** a list. In dictionaries, keys must be *immutable* (that's why using a tuple
> is fine, but using a list is not).
> If you're curious about why `memo_diff` is different than `memo` and is implemented in this way, reference the dropdown below:

More Information (enable JavaScript)

How do `memo` and `memo_diff` differ? Although `memo` stores only the result of a function call, `memo_diff` takes into account an additional constraint, `limit`, that affects whether the cached result can be used or not. When the `memo_diff` function is called with a (`entered`, `source`) pair, it doesn’t just check if the pair has been seen before; it also checks if the `limit` is less than or equal to the cached `limit`. This is an additional check that `memo` does not perform.

Why is `limit` handled this way? We already know that the `limit` represents the maximum
difference that a diff function cares about—that is, differences above the `limit` might
as well be the same. So diff functions will provide an accurate difference value when it is
below the limit and an inaccurate one when it is above the limit. Therefore, we can trust a
cached difference value if it was calculated with a higher limit, but we can't trust ones
calculated with a lower limit.

For example, the result of the first call below would allow us to predict the result of
the second call. The higher limit provides us with more information. However, the second
call would not allow us to predict the first one.

```
>>> minimum_mewtations("hello", "hasldfasdfsffsfasdf", 100)
17
>>> minimum_mewtations("hello", "hasldfasdfsffsfasdf", 2)
3
```

  

Once you've implemented `memo_diff`, finish by:

1. Decorating `autocorrect` with `memo`.
2. Decorating `minimum_mewtations` with `memo_diff`.

Running `autocorrect` and `minimum_mewtations` should now be much faster!

> **Note**:
> If you are failing the autograder tests involving `call_count`, it is likely that your `minimum_mewtations` implementation (from Q7) is not having the *tightest base cases* possible and still needs some optimization.
> The tests from Q7 are not meant to be strict, so even if you passed the Q7 tests, your base cases might still not be the tightest.
> Make sure you are not making unnecessary recursive calls.
> We are being strict about this here because having the tightest base cases is crucial for the efficiency of your code.
>
> **Important**:
> Try it yourself first! Only consult the following common mistakes section if you have been stuck on one test case for a while. Otherwise, you might not learn as much from the project.

Common Mistakes (enable JavaScript)

* Consider the case `minimum_mewtations(entered = "maooo", source = "mao", limit = 0)`: since no transformations are allowed and the two words are not the same, how quick can your function figure out that the result is impossible?
* Consider the case `minimum_mewtations(entered = "habc", source = "hmao", limit = some_limit_greater_than_zero)`: Given that both strings start with the same character `h`, what is the most effective approach in this situation? Should the function even attempt to "add" (resulting in `habc` and `mao`) or "remove" (resulting in `abc` and `hmao`)? Does your implementation take advantage of this optimization?

> Note: The autograder takes a bit of time to run, but it should not be longer than 10 seconds.
